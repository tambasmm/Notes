### **1. What is Jenkins?**

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy software. It helps developers automate parts of the software development process, especially continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins that integrate with many tools in the DevOps ecosystem.
